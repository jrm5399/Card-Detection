# Card-Detection
Senior Design project that detects cards in real time and clusters cards into hands


# Perks of YOLO
* Using YOLOv3, We were able to use this CNN for real time card detection. 
* The reason we implemented YOLO over other models such as Faster RCNN or RetinaNet is because YOLO is a quick network that helps with a faster FPS for the project.
